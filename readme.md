### Introduction

The goal of this is to collect structured data for general consumption.

### DrumWork

This is being developed by the folks at [DrumWork](https://drum.work), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. DrumWork started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a seed of a project just beginning its development phases. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/mountbuild) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/teamdrumwork), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teamdrumwork), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/teamdrumwork). Check out our other GitHub projects as well!
